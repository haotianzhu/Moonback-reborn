# Moonback-reborn

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ® and an npm package manager.

- Node.js

 - Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.
 -To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.
 -To get Node.js, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

- npm package manager

 - Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as [npm packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/index.html). To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.

 - This Quick Start uses the [npm client](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.

 - To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window.
